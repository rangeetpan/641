Example of two outputs of the same code has been illustrated in the below snippet. \footnote{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55775450/different-classification-accuracy-every-time-i-train-models-on-the-same-dataset}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Motivating example of model verification to interpret accuracy for accountable ML]
//The first time execution of a CNN code gives this output:
3-NN, accuracy: 0.67, Confusion Matrix:
[[ 9  3  4]
[ 4 11  2]
[ 3  0 12]]

NAIVE BAYES: Accuracy: 0.83, Confusion Matrix:/n
[[15  0  1]
[ 2 13  2]
[ 2  1 12]]

LOGISTIC REGRESSION: Accuracy: 0.71, Confusion matrix:
[[13  2  1]
[ 5 11  1]
[ 4  1 10]]

\\ The second time execution of the same code returns:
3-NN, accuracy: 0.65, Confusion Matrix:
[[11  2  3]
[ 3 13  1]
[ 7  1  7]]

NAIVE BAYES: Accuracy: 0.85, Confusion Matrix:/n
[[15  1  0]
[ 1 14  2]
[ 1  2 12]]

LOGISTIC REGRESSION: Accuracy: 0.79, Confusion matrix:
[[13  0  3]
[ 0 14  3]
[ 1  3 11]]
\end{lstlisting}
