\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this section, I will present necessary background.
The objective of presenting the background here is to 
make the paper self-contained. 
After reading this section, even those readers who may
not be initially familar with the underlying ideas 
behind my technique will be able to understand the rest
of the paper.
