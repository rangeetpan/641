\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
\label{sec:future}
In this study, we have found the random initializations for which accuracy i.e., trustworthiness changes even if the experimental setup remains unchanged. After identifying these randomly initialized parameters, we have applied a search algorithm using user-provided maximum allowable time, trial, and gain from the actual accuracy in order to provide the near-optimal accuracy.
Thus, a user intent based near-optimal accuracy searching strategy has been introduced to restrict the learning process that makes a DNN model accountable in terms of classification accuracy. In future, we can extend ...
