\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
We have proposed a specification language and a framework to learn the distribution of the randomly initialized parameters to provide an interval for output metrics and leverage that to restrict a model from learning beyond a specified interval provided by the end-user. Our next steps will be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Accumulate the randomly initialized parameters.
	\item Mine models specifically image-based classification with dense operations to restrict the effort and find the distribution of the parameters.
	\item Formalize the assertion operation with the learned distribution.
\end{itemize}
In these steps, our goal is to deliver the first two steps for the next checkpoint of our project.
