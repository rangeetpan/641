\section{Future Plan}
\label{sec:future}
We have proposed a specification language and a framework to learn the distribution of the randomly initialized parameters so that we can generate a near optimum value for output metrics. Thus, we can leverage the acquired domain knowledge to restrict a model from learning beyond a specified interval provided by the end-user. Our next steps will be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item RQ1: We will evaluate our approach to find the best fit for $\delta$ parameter.
	\item RQ2: We will evaluate our approach in term of precision, recall, and F-score using the mined models for \emph{GitHub}.
	\item RQ3: We will evaluate the execution time.
\end{itemize}
Our goal is to deliver these items for the final checkpoint of our project.
