%Title: Enumerator, Packing-Unpacking and Zip Based on Lambda Calculus
Deep neural networks have gained large popularity in the past decade. Compared to the non-ML based system, there is not much existing verification mechanism for these learning-based models. One such verification technique includes the contract between the advertised trustworthiness and the actual performance of these models. Our study identifies that due to the random initialization, accuracy i.e., trustworthiness changes even if the experimental setup remains unchanged. In order to address this issue, we have proposed a mining-based approach to gain the domain knowledge of the input and the learning operations to generate an interval of the output metrics. We have also proposed a specification language to restrict the learning process that helps a DNN model to achieve accountability in the aspect of classification accuracy.
