%Title: Enumerator, Packing-Unpacking and Zip Based on Lambda Calculus
Deep neural networks have gained large popularity in the past decade. Compared to the non-ML based system, there is not much existing verification mechanism for these learning-based models. One such verification technique includes the contract between the advertised trustworthiness and the actual performance of these models. Our study identifies that due to the random initialization, accuracy i.e., trustworthiness changes even if the experimental setup remains unchanged. In order to address this issue, we have proposed an approach to identify these randomly initialized parameters and apply the search algorithm to find the corresponding value that provides the near optimal accuracy.
We have also proposed a user intent based technique to restrict the searching process in terms of time, trial and accuracy gain that helps a DNN model to achieve accountability in the aspect of classification accuracy.
 
%We have also proposed a specification language to restrict the learning process that helps a DNN model to achieve accountability in the aspect of classification accuracy.
