\section{Threat to Validity}
\label{sec:threat}
\subsection{Internal Threat:} In this proposed approach, we have discussed the implementation of the model based on the users' provided parameters i.e., learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers, etc. In order to alleviate the threat, we have utilized the implementation of the model by \emph{Tensorflow} library that can implement the architecture of the model and train on the provided dataset with tuning the parameters and setting the weight and bias.
\subsection{External Threat:} An external threat can be the choice of the dataset, to reduce the threat we have utilized two well-vetted datasets in the deep learning domain for our evaluation.
